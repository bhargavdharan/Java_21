# Difference Between Interpreter and Compiler.

## Interpreter:

**Translates program one statement at a time.**

**Interpreters usually take less amount of time to analyze the source code.However,the overall execution time is comparatively slower than compilers.

**No object code is generated,hence are memory efficient.

**Programming languages like javascript,python,Ruby use Interpreters.**

## Compiler:

**Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.**

** Compilers usually take a large amount of time to analyze the source code.However, the overall execution time is comparatively faster than Interpreters.

** Generates object code which further requires linking,hence requires more memory.

**Programming languages like c,c++,java use compilers**
